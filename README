CIUnit Foostack

Notes:
    - CIUnit was updated to work completely with CodeIgniter 2.0.3.
    	See also: https://bitbucket.org/kenjis/my-ciunit/wiki/Home
    	
    - CIUnit is completely separated from the CodeIgniter Core Files.
        > CIUnit has it's own modified core files and will load them only
          when needed (by using the console for instance).
        > CIUnit won't use the system index.php anymore, instead it'll use
          application/third_party/CIUnit/bootstrap_phpunit.php

          This is to prevent CIUnit/Foostack to cause any extra load on
          production.

          Folder structure:
              - application/third_party/CIUnit/bootstrap_phpunit.php (Application and System Folder)
              - tests/phpunit.xml (Optional: only edit if you want to move bootstrap_phpunit.php)

How to Use:
	Install:
		$ cp -R ciunit/application [CI2 Project Path]/
		$ cp -R ciunit/tests [CI2 Project Path]/
		
		If you use MY_Loader, MY_Output, MY_Session, please change the parent classes below:
			- application/third_party/CIUnit/core/CIU_*.php
			- application/third_party/CIUnit/libraries/CIU_*.php
		
	Run Tests:
		All Tests:
			$ cd [CI2 Project Path]/tests
			$ phpunit
			
		Some Tests:
			$ cd [CI2 Project Path]/tests
			$ phpunit models
			
		Single Test:
			$ cd [CI2 Project Path]/tests
			$ phpunit models/PhoneCarrierModelTest.php

Execute Tests of CodeIgniter Unit Testing Class:
	Limitation:
		You must execute all tests in index() function of testing controllers.
		
		Example:
			function index()
			{
				$this->test_no_additional_headers();
				$this->test_x_forwarded_for();
				$this->test_client_ip();
				$this->test_x_forwarded_for_and_client_ip();
				
				echo $this->unit->report();
			}
		
	See tests/controllers/CI_Unit_Test_class_Test.php.
	In test_CI_Unit_Test_Class() function, set the folder where testing controllers are in.

		$test_path = APPPATH . 'controllers';
		$test_folder = 'tests';
	
	It runs all *.php files in "application/controllers/tests" folder.
	
	PHPUnit shows all test file names and failed test names.
	If more than one test fails, PHPUnit reports 1 failure, even if 100 fails occurres.
