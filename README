CIUnit Foostack
    Originally created   by: Clemens "rafsoaken" Gruenberger
    Modified and Updated by:

Notes:
    - CIUnit was updated to work completely with CodeIgniter 2.0
    - CIUnit is completely separated from the CodeIgniter Core Files.
        > CIUnit has it's own modified core files and will load them only
          when needed (by using the console for instance).
        > CIUnit won't use the system index.php anymore, instead it'll use
          application/third_party/CIUnit/bootstrap_phpunit.php

          This is to prevent CIUnit/Foostack to cause any extra load on
          production.          

          Folder structure:
              - application/third_party/CIUnit/bootstrap_phpunit.php (Application and System Folder)
              - tests/phpunit.xml (Optional: only edit if you want to move bootstrap_phpunit.php)
